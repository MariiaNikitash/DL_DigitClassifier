# DL_DigitClassifier

Constructed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a MNIST data set from Tenserflow! <br>
Achieved 94.4% accurace score!
<br>
The steps I implemented:
Data Preparation -> defined model's struture -> optimization function -> loss function -> compiled the model -> fitted the model -> evaluated performance on the test data.<br> 
Output:
